## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
setwd(
"/Users/abhishekdubey/abhishek-git-repos/datasciencecoursera/reproducible-research/RepData_PeerAssessment1"
)
activity <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = "NA")
activity$date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(with(activity, date), "%Y-%m-%d"))

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
activitySummary <- select(activity, date, steps) %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(totalSteps = sum(steps), mean = mean(steps), median = median(steps))
hist(activitySummary$totalSteps, col = "red", xlab = "Total Steps", main = "Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day")
```

**Mean and Median of total number of steps taken per day**
```{r}
print(select(activitySummary, date, mean, median), n = nrow(activitySummary))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
